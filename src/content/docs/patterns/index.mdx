# Patterns

Patterns document proven, repeatable solutions to common UI design and composition problems. Unlike components (which solve a single element) or blocks (which solve a layout section), patterns show you *how to think* about combining LibyUI building blocks for recurring scenarios.

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="What makes something a pattern?">
    A pattern is a reusable approach — not a specific piece of code — that solves a class of problems. It describes the intent, the trade-offs, and the recommended composition, leaving implementation details to you.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Patterns vs. Recipes">
    Patterns are conceptual and broad (e.g. "loading states", "empty states", "confirmation flows"). Recipes are concrete and step-by-step (e.g. "build a delete confirmation dialog with a toast notification"). Use patterns for guidance, recipes for copy-paste starting points.
