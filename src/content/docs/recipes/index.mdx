# Recipes

Recipes are step-by-step, copy-paste-ready guides for building real-world features with LibyUI. Each recipe walks you through a concrete goal — from start to finished, working code.

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="What is a recipe?">
    A recipe is an end-to-end walkthrough for a specific UI task. It starts from a clear goal ("build a delete confirmation modal"), lists the components you'll need, and provides complete, working code you can drop into your project.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Recipes vs. Patterns">
    Recipes are concrete and opinionated — they show one good way to solve a specific problem. Patterns are conceptual and explore the trade-offs across multiple approaches. Use recipes when you want something working fast; use patterns when you're deciding on an approach.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I request a recipe?">
    Yes. Open an issue on GitHub with the title "Recipe Request: [your topic]" and describe what you're trying to build. High-demand requests get prioritized.
  </Accordion>
