# Components

LibyUI components are organized into two layers: **Primitives** and **Composite** components. Primitives are low-level, single-responsibility elements. Composite components combine primitives into higher-level, opinionated patterns.

## Primitives

Primitives are unstyled-first, accessibility-compliant building blocks. Each one maps closely to a Radix UI primitive and is extended with LibyUI variants, sizes, and design tokens.

<ul className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-4">
  <li>
    <a href="/docs/components/button" className="block p-6 border rounded-lg hover:bg-gray-50 transition-colors">
      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Button</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-600">Interactive button with multiple variants (default, destructive, success, info, outline, ghost, link) and sizes.</p>
    </a>
  </li>
</ul>

These are the currently documented primitive components. More are being added — check back soon or open a GitHub discussion to request one.

## Composite

Composite components are built from primitives and third-party libraries. They solve a specific, higher-level UI pattern out of the box.

<ul className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-4">
  <li>
    <a href="/docs/components/mode-toggle" className="block p-6 border rounded-lg hover:bg-gray-50 transition-colors">
      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Mode Toggle</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-600">Light / dark / system theme switcher built with next-themes, Radix Dropdown, and Tooltip.</p>
    </a>
  </li>
</ul>

Composite components are growing. Have a pattern you'd like to see here? Open an issue on GitHub.
