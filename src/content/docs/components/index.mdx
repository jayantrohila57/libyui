# Components

LibyUI components are organized into two layers: **Primitives** and **Composite** components. Primitives are low-level, single-responsibility elements. Composite components combine primitives into higher-level, opinionated patterns.

## Primitives

Primitives are unstyled-first, accessibility-compliant building blocks. Each one maps closely to a Radix UI primitive and is extended with LibyUI variants, sizes, and design tokens.

These are the currently documented primitive components. More are being added — check back soon or open a GitHub discussion to request one.

## Composite

Composite components are built from primitives and third-party libraries. They solve a specific, higher-level UI pattern out of the box.
