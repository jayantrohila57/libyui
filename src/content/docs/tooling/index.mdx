# Tooling

LibyUI comes with an opinionated but configurable developer toolchain. This section covers the CLI for scaffolding components, TypeScript setup, and the Biome linter/formatter configuration used in the project.

## Setup overview

<Steps>
  <Step>Install LibyUI and its peer dependencies via your package manager</Step>
  <Step>Run `pnpm shadcn` to initialize the component registry and generate your `components.json`</Step>
  <Step>Configure TypeScript path aliases (`@/`) in `tsconfig.json`</Step>
  <Step>Add Biome (or your preferred linter) for consistent formatting across the project</Step>
</Steps>

## Common questions

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Do I need the CLI?">
    No — you can copy component source files manually. The CLI (`pnpm shadcn`) just automates the process of adding components to your project and keeping them up to date.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do I have to use Biome?">
    No. LibyUI uses Biome internally for speed and zero-config formatting. You can use ESLint and Prettier instead — nothing in LibyUI depends on your linter choice at runtime.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I use LibyUI without TypeScript?">
    Yes, but you'll lose prop autocompletion and type safety for variants and sizes. TypeScript is strongly recommended for the best developer experience.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What version of Tailwind CSS is required?">
    LibyUI requires Tailwind CSS v4. It uses the PostCSS plugin (`@tailwindcss/postcss`) and the `tw-animate-css` package for animations. Make sure your `postcss.config.mjs` is configured accordingly.
