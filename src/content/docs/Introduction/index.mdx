# Introduction

LibyUI is a modern, accessible, and beautifully designed React component library built with **TypeScript** and **Tailwind CSS**. Components are crafted to help you build stunning web applications with confidence — without sacrificing accessibility or developer experience.

## Why LibyUI?

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Beautiful by default">
    Every component ships with a carefully considered visual design. You get great-looking UI from day one, with full freedom to restyle using Tailwind CSS classes or design tokens.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Accessible out of the box">
    Components are built on Radix UI primitives and follow WCAG 2.1 guidelines. Keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes, and focus management are handled for you.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="TypeScript-first">
    Every component is fully typed. You get autocomplete for props, variants, and sizes — and TypeScript will catch mistakes before they reach the browser.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Customizable with Tailwind CSS">
    LibyUI uses `class-variance-authority` for variants and `tailwind-merge` for safe class overrides. Pass any Tailwind class via `className` and it just works.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Mobile-first and responsive">
    All components and blocks are designed mobile-first. They adapt gracefully from small screens to large monitors without extra configuration.
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>
