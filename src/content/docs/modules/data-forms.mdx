# Data Forms

The Data Forms module provides a structured, validated approach to building forms in LibyUI applications. It is built from LibyUI's primitive components and designed to integrate with schema-validation libraries like Zod.

## Key concepts

<Accordion type="single" collapsible className="w-full">
  <AccordionItem value="item-1">
    <AccordionTrigger>Schema-driven fields</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      Define your form shape with a Zod schema, and the module infers field types, validation rules, and error messages automatically. This eliminates the manual wiring between your validation schema and your form UI.
    </AccordionContent>
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem value="item-2">
    <AccordionTrigger>Controlled vs. uncontrolled inputs</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      Data Forms supports both patterns. Use controlled inputs when you need to react to field values in real time (for dynamic field sets, conditional sections, etc.), or uncontrolled inputs for simpler, submit-only forms.
    </AccordionContent>
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem value="item-3">
    <AccordionTrigger>Multi-step forms</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      The module includes a `FormStepper` pattern for multi-step flows. Each step validates independently before advancing, so users see errors exactly when they're relevant.
    </AccordionContent>
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem value="item-4">
    <AccordionTrigger>Error handling</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      Validation errors are displayed inline, adjacent to the field that triggered them. Error messages come from your Zod schema and are fully customizable per field.
    </AccordionContent>
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

## Basic Usage

```tsx
import { z } from "zod";

const schema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(2, "Name must be at least 2 characters"),
  email: z.string().email("Please enter a valid email address"),
});

// Wire schema to your form library of choice (e.g. react-hook-form)
```

  <li>
    <a href="/docs/modules/data-table" className="block p-6 border rounded-lg hover:bg-gray-50 transition-colors">
      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Data Table</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-600">Display, sort, and filter tabular data using LibyUI components.</p>
    </a>
  </li>
</ul>
