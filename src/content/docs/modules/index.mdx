# Modules

Modules are higher-level, feature-complete building blocks composed from LibyUI primitives. Where components solve a single UI problem (a button, a card), modules solve an entire UI *feature* — like displaying and filtering a data table, or building a validated multi-step form.

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="How are modules different from components?">
    Components are fine-grained and single-purpose. Modules combine components, state management, and layout conventions to create entire interactive features. Think of a module as a fully wired-up section of your app, not just a visual building block.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How are modules different from blocks?">
    Blocks are visual layout sections (hero sections, footers, pricing tables). Modules are functional feature areas — they may have sorting, filtering, pagination, validation, and other interactive behaviour built in.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I use a module without the rest of LibyUI?">
    Modules depend on LibyUI primitives for their UI layer, so you need the core components installed. The business logic parts (sorting, validation) are standalone and can be extracted if needed.
